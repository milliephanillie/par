            "description": "Google has given access to its new Search Generative Experience to many top SEOs. Here's a breakdown of some of the most popular SERPs in the SEO industry.",
            "articleBody": "It seems all of SEO Twitter was whitelisted for the first to get a preview and early access to Google's new generative AI experience on the SERPs; something that many others are still on the waitlist for. There's a ton of chatter, so I wanted to put together a post on what the new experience is looking like for a multitude of different keywords and query types including local, transactional (ecommerce), SERPs that pull up featured snippets, and lead generation based SERPs, and more. It also seems like you will be able to give google commands, such as comparing items or businesses, or asking for advice. Key Takeaways include that reviews will be more important. Google's local results for their SGE seem like they rely more on ratings than listicles or 'Best of' articles. The Search Journey is now more relevant than ever with Google automatically adopting Generative AI when it comes to both local and ecommerce/transactional queries. Even if a query is clearly transactional, Google will surface some informational content, and give users a toolbar to ask follow up questions - meaning that SEOs need to start thinking about the search journey as multi-dimensional. Sometimes, Google is confused about query types. Being in the top 3 organic results doesn't guarantee that you will be featured in the SGE carousel. Google's SGE sometimes clearly rips the contact exactly as it is stated. If featured snippets caused backlash, then generative AI will definitely sound some alarms. Google's SGE will sometimes not answer a question, and instead prompt you to click through to a restaurant or find the answer yourself. Loading the SGE takes quite a while and generative AI seems to go against Google's ideology that 'low cumulative layout shift is important'. More examples of Google's SGE include Local Queries, 'Best' Queries, Real Estate, Real Time, Financial, Gossip, SEO Queries, and Advice Queries. Google is removing the 'More Places' in local queries and is aiming to create a more modular experience for their Google Places. Users will now be able to click on a scrollable places listing. Many queries have duplicate results, and are a mirror of what is already showing featured snippets. Some queries also leave it up to the user to decide if the answer is contradictory or not. For example, the following shows Wednesday and Saturday twice. This is also another clear example of AI taking what the top result is saying and plagiarizing it. To elaborate on a system for which Google is trying to accomplish; it seems like they are banking on the featured snippet at first, and experimenting with coming up with a better answer, in a (sometimes) duplicate, fully AI generated, response. Some real estate SGE queries are also given. It will be interesting to see if Google will soon have some SERPs that are in real time, such as a surf report or the weather. Google is taking its cue from the crypto moon boys, and letting people know that this is 'not financial advice'. The many angles of JLo's love of grilled cheese are also discussed. Every SEO's favorite SERPS are also illustrated. It will be interesting to see what happens over time with the advice that SGE gives. Could be dangerous if it pertains to health, or something that dictates action."

                    <p>It seems all of SEO Twitter was whitelisted first to get a preview and early access to Google's new generative AI experience on the SERPs, something that many others are still on the waitlist for.</p>

                    <p>There's a ton of chatter, so I put together a post on what the new experience looks like for a multitude of different keywords and query types including local, transactional (ecommerce), SERPs that pull up featured snippets, and lead generation based SERPs, and more.</p>

                    <p>It also appears that you will be able to give Google commands, such as comparing items or businesses, or asking for advice.</p>

                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <h4>Reviews will be more important</h4>
                    <p>Google's local results for their SGE seem like they rely more on ratings than listicles or "Best of" articles.</p>
                    <h4>The Search Journey is Now More Relevant Than Ever</h4>
                    <p>Google is automatically adopting Generative AI when it comes to both local and ecommerce/transactional queries. Perhaps trying to get their foot in the door when it comes to transactions?</p>

                    <p>Even if a query is clearly transactional, Google will surface some informational content, and give users a toolbar to ask follow up questions - that means that SEOs need to start thinking about the search journey as multi-dimensional.</p>

                    <h4>Sometimes, Google is confused about query types</h4>
                    <p>Sometimes Google's generative AI can't decide if a query falls into a certain bucket. Is it a local query? A transactional query?</p>

                    <h4>Different results than traditional organic</h4>
                    <p>Being in the top 3 organic results doesn't guarantee that you will be featured in the SGE carousel.</p>

                    <img src="images/sge/sge-local-best-things-to-do-in-brooklyn.jpg" alt="SGE vs Organic" />

                    <h4>SGE and plagiarism</h4>
                    <p>It sometimes clearly rips the content exactly as it is stated. Is it what the people want? Probably, but if featured snippets caused backlash, then generative AI will definitely sound some alarms.</p>

                    <img src="images/sge/sge-plagiarism-how-long-does-it-take-to-get-over-a-breakup.jpg" alt="SGE plagiarism" />

                    <h4>SGE will sometimes not answer a question</h4>
                    <p>Take, for example, the following question asking for a restaurant's hours. Google will instead prompt you to click through to a restaurant or find the answer yourself.</p>

                    <img src="images/sge/sge-wont-answer-what-are-juniors-hours.jpg" alt="SGE won't answer" />

                    <h4>SGE load time is long</h4>
                    <p>Loading takes quite a while and generative AI seems to go against Google's ideology that "low cumulative shift is important."</p>

                    <img src="images/sge/sge-low-cumulative-shift.jpg" alt="SGE Load Times" />

                    <h3>More Examples of Google's SGE</h3>
                    <h4>Local Queries</h4>
                    <p>Google is removing the "More Places" in local queries (reducing the opportunities in the value pack), and is aiming to create a more modular experience for their Google Places rather than entering a local finder or Google Maps in its entirety.</p>

                    <p>Users will now be able to click on a scrollable places listing; and it looks like that is in response to preparing for SGE:</p>

                    <img src="images/sge/sge-local-compare-two-restaurants.jpg" alt="SGE compare" />

                    <img src="images/sge/sge-local-pizza-near-me.jpg" alt="SGE near me" />

                    <h4>"Best" Queries</h4>
                    <p>Many queries have duplicate results, and are a mirror of what is already showing featured snippets. Some queries also leave it up to the user to decide if the answer is contradictory or not; for example, the following shows Wednesday and Saturday twice. This is also another clear example of AI taking what the top result is saying and – dare I say again – plagiarizing it?</p>

                    <p>To elaborate on a system that Google is trying to accomplish; it seems like they are banking on the featured snippet at first, and experimenting with coming up with a better answer, in a (sometimes) duplicate, fully AI-generated, response.</p>
