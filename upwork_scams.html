            "description": "Google has given access to its new Search Generative Experience to many top SEOs. Here's a breakdown of some of the most popular SERPs in the SEO industry.",
            "articleBody": "It seems all of SEO Twitter was whitelisted for the first to get a preview and early access to Google's new generative AI experience on the SERPs; something that many others are still on the waitlist for. There's a ton of chatter, so I wanted to put together a post on what the new experience is looking like for a multitude of different keywords and query types including local, transactional (ecommerce), SERPs that pull up featured snippets, and lead generation based SERPs, and more. It also seems like you will be able to give google commands, such as comparing items or businesses, or asking for advice. Key Takeaways include that reviews will be more important. Google's local results for their SGE seem like they rely more on ratings than listicles or 'Best of' articles. The Search Journey is now more relevant than ever with Google automatically adopting Generative AI when it comes to both local and ecommerce/transactional queries. Even if a query is clearly transactional, Google will surface some informational content, and give users a toolbar to ask follow up questions - meaning that SEOs need to start thinking about the search journey as multi-dimensional. Sometimes, Google is confused about query types. Being in the top 3 organic results doesn't guarantee that you will be featured in the SGE carousel. Google's SGE sometimes clearly rips the contact exactly as it is stated. If featured snippets caused backlash, then generative AI will definitely sound some alarms. Google's SGE will sometimes not answer a question, and instead prompt you to click through to a restaurant or find the answer yourself. Loading the SGE takes quite a while and generative AI seems to go against Google's ideology that 'low cumulative layout shift is important'. More examples of Google's SGE include Local Queries, 'Best' Queries, Real Estate, Real Time, Financial, Gossip, SEO Queries, and Advice Queries. Google is removing the 'More Places' in local queries and is aiming to create a more modular experience for their Google Places. Users will now be able to click on a scrollable places listing. Many queries have duplicate results, and are a mirror of what is already showing featured snippets. Some queries also leave it up to the user to decide if the answer is contradictory or not. For example, the following shows Wednesday and Saturday twice. This is also another clear example of AI taking what the top result is saying and plagiarizing it. To elaborate on a system for which Google is trying to accomplish; it seems like they are banking on the featured snippet at first, and experimenting with coming up with a better answer, in a (sometimes) duplicate, fully AI generated, response. Some real estate SGE queries are also given. It will be interesting to see if Google will soon have some SERPs that are in real time, such as a surf report or the weather. Google is taking its cue from the crypto moon boys, and letting people know that this is 'not financial advice'. The many angles of JLo's love of grilled cheese are also discussed. Every SEO's favorite SERPS are also illustrated. It will be interesting to see what happens over time with the advice that SGE gives. Could be dangerous if it pertains to health, or something that dictates action."

            <h1>Three UpWork Freelancer Scams to Be Aware of</h1>

            <p>The scam world is getting huge. Scammers make billions of dollars each and every single year. The numbers are getting bigger and the "cons" are getting "longer."</p>

            <p>Scams on UpWork are more commonly reported on the client side of things, where the transfer of funds is more direct, but they also happen on the Freelancer side - and these are where the scams tend to be a little more advanced.</p>

            <p>Significant effort is being put into social engineering - scammers will begin following you on social networks, build relationships with you, and aren't even afraid to hop on Google calls these days.</p>

            <p>It's important to stay vigilant. If you follow the UpWork terms of service, it can prevent you from being scammed. The platform has also outlined a guide on preventing these types of attacks as well as how to report them.</p>

            <h2>Here are three common types of those scams:</h2>

            <h3>The Fake Website FTP Login</h3>

            <p>This scam involves getting applicants to start work early on UpWork before the contract begins. The conversation will be initiated through the UpWork system but the contract will never be started.</p>

            <p>The perpetrators will look to capitalize on the fact that many freelancers are forced to do their due diligence on a project and begin researching and working before a contract is in place. This is because in order to be effective as a freelancer, you have to be prepared.</p>

            <p>The scammer will show you their "Ecommerce" store (or any other website really), usually with a strange URL, list of products, and a number of errors on the website. Often times a less frequently used CMS is what the scammers are using for this fake store.</p>

            <p>Once presented with the site and the initial job details, the "client" will give you login details, and ask you to scope things out via FTP; They know that if you login it presents the opportunity to install malware on your computer.</p>

            <p>Do not log into any FTP client (or any other hosting provider) without the contract being started on UpWork.</p>

            <h3>The Rev Share Scam</h3>

            <p>This is a scam where an offer is made to you for a rev share deal. The scammer proposes that they will do all the work, and you can keep 20% or so, if you just let them use your UpWork profile to bid on projects.</p>

            <p>The scammer will throw out a large number of the money that they intend to bring in. They know that if they say they will make around at least $10K a month and you can keep 20%, that it will cause eyes to light up.</p>

            <p>They will target US workers which are more likely to farm out the work in the first place, and who also know that they have access to the lucrative US market. They may also ask you to purchase a cheap $300 laptop and use a service like TeamFinder for the sole purpose of letting them log in and propose contracts.</p>

            <p>What actually ends up happening is the scammers will bid on a plethora of hourly projects, and bill the clients, but never actually do any of the work. This will leave you with an unusable UpWork account, terrible reviews, and a number of other problems to face.</p>

            <p>If it weren't for the fact that this is a scam, it would actually be a pretty good idea; but one that is too good to be true. It's also important to note that this is against UpWork's terms of service. You shouldn't be letting anyone else log in to use your account.</p>

            <h3>The Google Drive Proposal Scam</h3>

            <p>The Google Drive Proposal scam is done through Gmail and Google Drive. That means that the scammer will have a vague Gmail address, whereas in the other scams it's more common to have a Hotmail address or one less traceable by Google.</p>

            <p>What the scammer will do is send you an email outlining what amounts to fake project details. There will be a thank you for "your interest" in the project along with a link to a Google Drive attachment.</p>

            <p>In 2024, it's important to be more vigilant than ever. Scammers have infiltrated the Google search engine results (SERPs) by cloaking IPs and serving up different content, job postings, WhatsApp messaging, and other various platforms.</p>

            <p>UpWork is no different. It's a targeted platform because scammers know the workers on the platform are actually making money. Here are some common signs of an UpWork/Freelancer scam:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Asking to do work before being hired for the project</li>
                <li>First contact is outside of the platform</li>
                <li>Against UpWork's terms of service</li>
                <li>Odd looking websites, design comps, or web properties that just *feel* fake</li>
                <li>Generic email addresses</li>
                <li>A "Too good to be true" factor</li>
                <li>Aggressive following on social media (following you on GitHub, liking your tweets, etc)</li>
                <li>Odd remarks in communication</li>
            </ul>
